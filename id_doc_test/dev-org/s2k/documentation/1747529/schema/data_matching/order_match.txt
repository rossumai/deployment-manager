### PO matching

This configuration is designed to populate the "PO Number (Match)" field (schema_id: `order_match`).

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: `s2k_purchase_orders`

**Query Process:**
1. The configuration queries the `s2k_purchase_orders` dataset to find records where:
   - The "PO Number" field matches the value in `{order_id_normalized}`
   - The "PO Number" field is not empty

**Result Handling:**
- If no matching records are found: The default value (empty string with label "---") is selected
- If exactly one matching record is found: The "PO Number" value from that record is selected
- If multiple matching records are found: The "PO Number" value from the first record is selected

The configuration maps the "PO Number" field from the dataset to the `order_match` schema field.
