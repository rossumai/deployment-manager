### Calculating Discounts (S2K PO) (670292)

**Summary:** Analyzes payment terms text to extract discount information and payment schedules, storing the structured data in the document_terms_llm_guess field.

**Logic:**
- Extracts payment terms from the document
- Parses the terms using an LLM to identify key payment information including:
  - Days to pay net amount
  - Days to get discount
  - Day of month for payments
  - Whether payments are from current or next month
  - Discount percentage
- Stores the structured JSON result in the document_terms_llm_guess field
- Only processes if payment terms are present
