  "Description": "This extension is a scheduled serverless function that runs every 10 minutes to trigger a refresh by invoking another hook specified by the hook_id setting. It uses the Rossum API client to make a POST request to the specified hook's invoke endpoint. The function doesn't directly manipulate any document fields but acts as a trigger for another process."
