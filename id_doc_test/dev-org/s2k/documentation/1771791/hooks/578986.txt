### Receipt Checking (S2K PO) [578986]

**Summary:** This extension is configured to run on a schedule every 10 minutes for postponed documents in the S2K PO queue, but is effectively inactive as it uses a "never_true" target value condition.

**Logic:**
- Should not be used (as stated in the description)
- Configured to run on a schedule (every 10 minutes) but only triggers when target values match "never_true" (which will never happen)
- Targets the "receipts_flag" schema ID

**Active Queues:**
- S2K PO (1771791)

**Events:**
- invocation.manual
