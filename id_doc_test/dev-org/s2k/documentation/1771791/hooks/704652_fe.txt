  "Description": "This extension assigns or removes a specific label (with ID 94) to an annotation based on the value of the 'preferred_vendor_match' field. It compares the field value against configured conditions: if the value meets the 'add_condition', the label is added; if it matches the 'remove_condition', the label is removed. The extension supports various comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) for numeric values."
