### Refresh Documents (S2K PO) (771116)

**Summary:** This extension checks for documents in review with PO numbers and updates their receipt flag status based on matching records found in the S2K receipts data storage collection.

**Logic:**
- Fetches all annotations with status 'to_review' or 'postponed' from the S2K PO queue
- For each annotation, extracts the PO number from the 'order_id_normalized' field
- Queries the data storage collection 's2k_receipts' to find matching PO records
- If a match is found, updates the 'receipts_flag_extension' field to "true"

**Active Queues:**
- S2K PO (1771791)
