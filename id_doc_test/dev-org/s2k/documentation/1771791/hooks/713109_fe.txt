  "Description": "This extension saves mapping associations between invoice item codes and PO item codes for S2K purchase orders. It triggers when an annotation status changes to confirmed, exported, or failed_export. The extension extracts specified fields from line items (item_order_id_match, item_code_normalized, selected_vendor_id, item_description) and stores them in a data storage collection called 'associations_s2k_item_codes'. It handles duplicate records based on configured natural keys and can be configured to keep the first/oldest record when duplicates are found."
