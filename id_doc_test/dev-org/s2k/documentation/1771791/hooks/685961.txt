### Save UOM Ratios (S2K PO) (685961)

**Summary:** This extension saves unit of measure (UOM) ratios between order and invoice quantities for S2K purchase orders, storing them in a database for future reference.

**Logic:**
- Triggers when an annotation status changes to confirmed, exported, or failed_export
- Extracts vendor ID, item ID, and calculated ratio between order and invoice quantities
- Saves these ratios to a data storage collection called "associations_s2k_uom_ratios"
- Only saves ratios when the user has explicitly marked "Save Ratio" as "Yes"
- Uses vendor ID and item ID as unique natural keys to prevent duplicate entries
- Maintains the first occurrence of a ratio when duplicates are found (keep_first=True)

**Active Queues:**
- S2K PO (1771791)

**Events:**
- annotation_status.changed
