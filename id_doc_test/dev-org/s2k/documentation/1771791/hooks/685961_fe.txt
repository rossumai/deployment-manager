  "Description": "This extension saves UOM (Unit of Measure) ratios between order quantities and invoice quantities for S2K Purchase Orders. It extracts vendor ID, item ID, and calculated ratio information from confirmed annotations, and stores this data in a collection called 'associations_s2k_uom_ratios'. The extension only saves records where the item_save_ratio field is set to 'Yes', the item has a valid order ID match, and the calculated ratio is not zero. It uses unique natural keys based on vendor and item IDs to prevent duplicate entries."
