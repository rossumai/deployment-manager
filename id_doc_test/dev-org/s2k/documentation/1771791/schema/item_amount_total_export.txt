### Total Amount (Controlled) (item_amount_total_export)

* **Description**: This field calculates the total monetary amount by multiplying quantity by unit price. For exported items, it takes the export quantity and export unit price values, converts them from strings to numbers (removing any commas), and multiplies them together. If the item is not matched to an inventory item (no item_order_match value), it uses the standard total amount field instead. The result is rounded to 2 decimal places.
