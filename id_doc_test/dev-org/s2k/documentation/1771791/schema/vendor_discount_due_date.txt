### Vendor Due Date for Discount (vendor_discount_due_date)

* **Description**: This field calculates the date by which payment must be made to receive a vendor discount. The calculation works in one of two ways:
  * If a specific day of the month is set for the discount (vendor_discount_day_of_month), it will use that day in either the current month or next month (depending on the vendor_discount_beginning_month setting)
  * Otherwise, it adds the number of days specified in vendor_discount_period to the invoice issue date
  * If no issue date is available, the field will be empty

* **Field type**: formula

* **Data type**: date

* **Required**: false
