### Receipt flag header matching

This configuration is designed to populate the `receipts_flag_match` field by matching purchase order numbers from the `s2k_receipts` dataset.

**Dataset**: `s2k_receipts`

**Query Process**:
- The configuration executes a query on the `s2k_receipts` dataset
- It searches for records where the `PO Number` field matches the value in `{order_id_normalized}`
- The `PO Number` value from the matching record is mapped to the `receipts_flag_match` field

**Result Handling**:
- If no match is found: The default value is used (empty string with label "---")
- If one match is found: The `PO Number` value from the matching record is selected
- If multiple matches are found: The first matching `PO Number` value is selected

This configuration essentially flags whether a receipt exists in the system for a given order ID by populating the `receipts_flag_match` field with the matching PO number when found.
