### PO header matching

This configuration is designed to match purchase order information from the `s2k_purchase_orders` dataset.

**Dataset**: `s2k_purchase_orders`

**Query Process**:
- The configuration runs a query that attempts to match records in the `s2k_purchase_orders` dataset where the `PO Number` field equals the value in the `order_id_normalized` field from the document being processed.
- The query groups the results by `PO Number` and returns the first matching document for each unique PO Number.

**Field Population**:
- The `order_id_match` field (labeled as "PO Number (Match)" in the UI) will be populated with the value from the `PO Number` field in the matched record.
- If no match is found, the field will be set to an empty string with a label of "---".
- If one match is found, the value from the first (best) match will be used.
- If multiple matches are found, the value from the first (best) match will be used.

This configuration helps to validate and match purchase order numbers from incoming documents against existing purchase orders in the system.
