### Vendor Payment Terms Match

This configuration populates the `vendor_terms_match` field by querying the `payment_terms` dataset.

**Query Process:**
- The configuration searches the `payment_terms` dataset for records where the "Payment Terms" field matches the value in `{selected_vendor_terms_id}`.
- Dataset keys referenced: "Payment Terms"

**Result Handling:**
- If no match is found: The default value (label: "---", value: "") is used
- If exactly one match is found: The best match (first result) is selected
- If multiple matches are found: The best match (first result) is selected, and a warning message "Multiple matches found" is displayed

**Field Population:**
- The value from the "Payment Terms" field in the matched record is used to populate the `vendor_terms_match` field
- The label displayed will be formatted using the "Description" field from the matched record

This configuration is part of a vendor payment terms validation process, checking if the selected vendor terms ID exists in the payment terms master data.
