### Received quantity + UOM LineItem Matching

This configuration populates the `item_receipt_id_match` field by querying the `s2k_receipts` dataset to find matching receipt line items.

**Dataset**: `s2k_receipts`

**Queries**:
1. First query attempts to match by both PO number and item code:
   - Matches records where `PO Number` equals the value in `order_id_normalized` AND `Item Number` equals the value in `item_order_id_match`
   - Groups the results by `Item Number`
   - Calculates the total received quantity by summing the `Receipt Quantity` field (converted to double)
   - Adds the calculated total quantity to the original record

2. Second query (runs if first query returns no results) matches by PO number only:
   - Matches records where `PO Number` equals the value in `order_id_normalized`
   - Groups the results by `Item Number`
   - Calculates the total received quantity by summing the `Receipt Quantity` field (converted to double)
   - Adds the calculated total quantity to the original record

**Result Actions**:
- If no matches are found: Displays a warning message "No receipt match found"
- If exactly one match is found: Selects the best match (first result)
- If multiple matches are found: Selects the default value (empty string with label "---")

**Mapping**:
- The value from the `Item Number` field is stored in `item_receipt_id_match`
- The label is formatted as "[Description 1] ([Item Number])"

**Action Condition**:
- This configuration only runs if `item_match_po_flag` equals "true"

**Referenced Schema IDs**:
- `order_id_normalized`
- `item_order_id_match`
- `item_match_po_flag`
