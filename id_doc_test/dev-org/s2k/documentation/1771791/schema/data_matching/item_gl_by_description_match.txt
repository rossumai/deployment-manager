### Find GL by description

This configuration populates the field `item_gl_by_description_match` which is labeled as "GL by Description (Match)" in the UI.

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: `s2k_descriptions_gl_codes`

**Query Process:**
The configuration executes a single query that searches for records in the `s2k_descriptions_gl_codes` dataset where the `NAME` field matches the value from `item_description` field using a case-insensitive regular expression match.

**Referenced Fields:**
- `item_description` - Used in the regex pattern to match against the `NAME` field

**Result Handling:**
- If no matches are found: The default value is selected (empty string with label "---")
- If exactly one match is found: The value from the `GL` field of the matched record is selected
- If multiple matches are found: The default value is selected (empty string with label "---")

The selected value is then assigned to the `item_gl_by_description_match` field.
