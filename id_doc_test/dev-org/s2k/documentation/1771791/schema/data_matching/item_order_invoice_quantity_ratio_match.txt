### Ratios

This configuration is used to populate the "Order Invoice Ratio (Match)" field.

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: `associations_s2k_uom_ratios`

**Query Process:**
The configuration executes a single query that searches for records in the `associations_s2k_uom_ratios` dataset where:
- `item_id` equals the value of the `item_order_id_match` field

**Data Mapping:**
- When a record is found, the `ratio` value from the dataset is mapped to the `item_order_invoice_quantity_ratio_match` field

**Result Handling:**
- If no matching record is found, a default value is used (empty string with label "---")
- If exactly one matching record is found, that record's `ratio` value is selected
- If multiple matching records are found, the default value is used (empty string with label "---")

This configuration helps determine the ratio between order and invoice quantities for matched items.
