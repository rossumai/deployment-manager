### Branch header matching

This configuration is designed to populate the `branch_id` field by matching data from the `s2k_locations` dataset.

**Dataset:** `s2k_locations`

**Query Process:**
- The configuration executes a query against the `s2k_locations` dataset
- It searches for records where the `Location Number` field equals the value in `{order_location_match}`
- When a match is found, the `Profit Center` value from the matched record is used to populate the `branch_id` field

**Result Handling:**
- If no match is found: The default value (empty string) is used with label "---"
- If exactly one match is found: That match's `Profit Center` value is selected
- If multiple matches are found: The default value is used (empty string) and a warning message "Multiple matches found" is displayed

This configuration essentially performs a lookup to find the appropriate branch ID based on a location number match.
