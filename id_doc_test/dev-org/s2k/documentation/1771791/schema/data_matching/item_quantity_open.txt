### Invoiced Quantity (Accrual) LineItem Matching

This configuration populates the field `item_quantity_open` which represents the open quantity for matching items.

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: `s2k_accruals`

**Query Process:**
The configuration executes a single query that:
1. Matches records in the `s2k_accruals` dataset where:
   - `PO Number` equals the value in `order_id_normalized`
   - `Item Number` equals the value in `item_order_id_match`
2. Groups the results by `Item Number`
3. Calculates the sum of `Open Quantity` (converted to a double) for each group as `total_quantity_open`
4. Preserves the original document structure while adding the calculated `total_quantity_open` field

**Result Handling:**
- If no matches are found: Returns the default value (empty string with label "---")
- If exactly one match is found: Selects the `total_quantity_open` value from the matching record
- If multiple matches are found: Returns the default value and displays a warning message "Multiple matches found"

**Field Mapping:**
The `total_quantity_open` value from the query result is mapped to the `item_quantity_open` field in the target schema.
