### GL matching (preselection 201000)

This configuration populates the "GL Code" field (`item_gl_code_match`) by querying the `s2k_po_gl_codes` dataset. The query is executed only when `item_preselected_gl_code` is not empty, as specified in the action condition.

The query searches for GL codes where:
- The branch is either null or matches the `item_branch_id_normalized` value
- Creates a `dm_id` field by concatenating the GL code with the preselected GL code
- Adds an `is_preselected` field that is true when the GL code matches the preselected GL code
- Sorts the results with preselected items first

Dataset keys referenced:
- `gl_code`
- `description`
- `branch`

When a match is found (either one or multiple), the system selects the first result (best match) which, due to the sorting, would be the preselected GL code if it exists. If no match is found, an error message "No match found" is displayed.

### GL matching (no preselection schema_id = no best_match preselection)

This configuration also populates the "GL Code" field (`item_gl_code_match`) by querying the `s2k_po_gl_codes` dataset, but is executed only when `item_preselected_gl_code` is empty.

The query searches for GL codes where:
- The branch is either null or matches the `item_branch_id_normalized` value
- Creates a `dm_id` field by concatenating the GL code with the preselected GL code (which is empty in this case)

Dataset keys referenced:
- `gl_code`
- `description`
- `branch`

When exactly one match is found, the system selects it as the best match. If multiple matches are found, the default value (empty with label "---") is selected. If no match is found, an error message "No match found" is displayed.
