### PO Vendor name and terms matching

This configuration populates the `order_vendor_name_match` field by querying the `vendors` dataset.

**Query Process:**
- The configuration queries the `vendors` dataset
- It searches for records where the `Supplier Number` field matches the value in `order_vendor_match`
- When a match is found, the `Name` field from the vendor record is mapped to `order_vendor_name_match`

**Result Handling:**
- If no match is found: The default value (empty string with label "---") is used
- If exactly one match is found: The `Name` value from the matching vendor record is used
- If multiple matches are found: The default value is used and a warning message "Multiple matches found" is displayed

This configuration helps to automatically populate the vendor name field based on a vendor number match from the vendors dataset.
