### Preferred Vendors (find vendor ID in a dedicated list)

This configuration populates the `Preferred Vendor (Match)` field by searching for a vendor ID in a dedicated list of preferred vendors.

**Source Dataset:** `preferred_vendors`

**Query Description:**
The configuration executes a MongoDB query that:
1. Searches the `preferred_vendors` dataset for records where the `VENDOR CODE` field matches the value in `{selected_vendor_id}`
2. Groups the results by `VENDOR CODE` and keeps the first matching record
3. Adds a field called `flag` with the value `"Y"` to the matching record

**Dataset Keys Referenced:**
- `VENDOR CODE` - Used to match against the selected vendor ID
- `flag` - Added field that indicates a match was found

**Result Handling:**
- If no match is found: The default value is selected (label: "---", value: "0")
- If exactly one match is found: The first match is selected, and the `flag` value ("Y") is assigned to the `preferred_vendor_match` field
- If multiple matches are found: The first match is selected, and a warning message "Multiple matches found" is displayed

The `preferred_vendor_match` field is populated with "Y" when the vendor ID exists in the preferred vendors list, otherwise it's set to "0".
