### Invoice Number (Exported) (invoice_number_normalized)

- **Description**: This field calculates a normalized invoice number. If a document ID exists, it will be cleaned and used as the invoice number. If no document ID exists but a date is available, it will generate an invoice number using the date and the last 4 characters of the annotation ID. If neither exists, it will show an error. For long document IDs, it applies various truncation rules to keep the final value at 12 characters or less.
