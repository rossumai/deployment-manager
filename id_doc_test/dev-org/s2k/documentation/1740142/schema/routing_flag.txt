### Routing Flag (routing_flag)

* **Description**: This field automatically determines how a document should be routed based on other fields. It sets the value to "dropship" if there's an order match and the dropship flag is "D", sets it to "s2k_po" if there's an order match but the dropship flag is not "D", sets it to "non_s2k" if both order match and normalized order ID are empty, and shows an error if none of these conditions are met, preventing automation.

* **Field type**: formula

* **Data type**: string
