### PO matching

This configuration is designed to populate the `order_match` field, which is labeled as "PO Number (Match)" in the UI.

**Data Source:**
- Dataset: `s2k_purchase_orders`

**Query Process:**
The configuration executes a single query that:
1. Searches for records in the `s2k_purchase_orders` dataset where:
   - The `PO Number` field matches the value in `{order_id_normalized}`
   - The `PO Number` field is not empty

**Result Handling:**
- If no matching records are found: The default value (empty string with label "---") is used
- If exactly one match is found: The value from the `PO Number` field of the matching record is selected
- If multiple matches are found: The value from the `PO Number` field of the first matching record is selected

The selected value from the `PO Number` field in the dataset is mapped to the `order_match` schema field.
