### (S2K PO) - Document Splitting (702347)

## Summary
This extension automatically splits multi-document files into individual documents based on configurable text search rules. It identifies document boundaries by searching for specific phrases like "REMITTANCE ADVICE", "This Memorandum", and "Bill of Lading".

## Logic
The extension uses text search rules to identify where to split documents:

1. **Rule Type**: All rules are configured as `text_search` with suggestion enabled
2. **Split Triggers**:
   - When "REMITTANCE ADVICE" is found (with tolerance of 1), split before this page
   - When "This Memorandum" is found (with tolerance of 1), split before this page
   - When "Bill of Lading" is found (with tolerance of 1), split before this page
3. **Tolerance**: All rules have a tolerance value of 1, allowing for minor text variations
4. **Split Position**: All rules are configured to split before the page containing the trigger phrase
