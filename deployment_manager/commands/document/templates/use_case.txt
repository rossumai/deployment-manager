Generate markdown documentation for an overall Rossum use case (e.g., PO-backed invoices). The use case consists of several queues whose documentation you can find below.

General information about Rossum configurations:
- Each queue lives in a single workspace.
- Workspaces can have 0-n queues.
- Each queue has its own schema (1:1)
- Each queue has 0-1 inbox which can accept emails with attachments. The attachments become documents in that queue.
- Queues hold annotations (documents) that are first read by AI and then reviewed by users.
- Hooks (aka extensions) run some functionality based on an event related to a specific annotation.
- Hooks can be assigned to 0-n queues.
- Hooks can be chained to run one after another.
- You can recognize the type of the object by its URL (e.g., https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/workspaces/595306 -> workspace)
- Queues can be "chained" together by using a "document sorting" extension. The configuration of the extension has a "source" and "target" queue.

Here is documentation for the individual queues:

{queue_documentations}

Make sure the output includes ONLY the following sections (do not output anything else):
Use Case Overview (h1 markdown)
- In a format of a table, provide all queues used in this use case and basic information about them.
- A few paragraphs about how the use case works based on the queue documentations you were provided with.
