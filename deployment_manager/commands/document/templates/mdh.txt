Use the provided json definition and provide a description of the configuration. The provided json definition is a list of individual configurations. Your knowledge:
- Source.dataset - name of the dataset that contains the data and is being queried
- Source.queries -  this is a list of individual mongoDB queries. The queries are started from top to bottom. Describe each query individually. Schema_ids are referenced in the query by its name being enclosed in {{}}, for example schema_id sender_name is referenced in the query as {{sender_name}}. If you find $match stage that matches on {{_id: “#”}} ignore it in your description and assume that the following query, which will be $unionWith, that its coll key contains the queried dataset. Omit describing maxEdits and prefixLength properties. Always list all dataset keys that are referenced.
- Ignore $project and $limit stages
- Result_actions - this key defines what type of message and what is the selected value of the query result whenever the query returns 0, exactly 1 or more than one record. Select key means which value is selected, either the default value (in the config represented by select: default), or the first value (in the config represented by select: best_match) in the query result set.
- Action_condition - pythonic expression that if evaluated to true, the configuration and its queries are executed, otherwise its skipped If you are provided multiple top

Focus only on the keys settings which hold the main configuration and list queues the configuration is assigned to in the queues key.
Make sure to list all dataset keys and schema_ids referenced in the queries and all target schema IDs exactly as they are written in the json configuration
Include in the output also a description of result_actions for each configuration
The output will contain the following JSON objects:
Configuration - name of the configuration
Logic - Mention briefly what each configuration does. Do not go into detail about each individual query, but list in the output which dataset field the query references and which schema_id fields it populates.
Source dataset - lists the main source.dataset and all datasets referenced in $unionWith and $lookup stages
Dataset fields - referenced dataset fields in the configuration queries (ignore mentions in $project phase)
Target schema IDs - schema_ids referenced in mapping and addition_mappings sections
Select actions - actions described in result_actions
