Here is schema id context - this serves only as a field label
{schema_id}

Use the provided json definition and provide a description of how the value of the field that is referenced in the json config in mapping.target_schema_id is populated. Omit description of fields referenced in additional_section. The json definition has a following structure
Source.dataset - name of the dataset that contains the data and is being queried
Source.queries -  this is a list of individual mongoDB queries. The queries are started from top to bottom. Describe each query individually. Schema_ids are referenced in the query by its name being enclosed in {{}}, for example schema_id sender_name is referenced in the query as {{sender_name}}. If you find $match stage that matches on {{_id: “#”}} ignore it in your description and assume that the following query, which will be $unionWith, that its coll key contains the queried dataset. Omit describing maxEdits and prefixLength properties. Always list all dataset keys that are referenced.
- Ignore $project and $limit stages
Result_actions - this key defines what type of message and what is the selected value of the query result whenever the query returns 0, exactly 1 or more than one record. Select key means which value is selected, either the default value (in the config represented by select: default), or the first value (in the config represented by select: best_match) in the query result set.
Action_condition - pythonic expression that if evaluated to true, the configuration and its queries are executed, otherwise its skipped
If you are provided multiple top level objects that reference the same or different dataset, describe them both equally in sufficient detail.

Here is MDH JSON config described above.
