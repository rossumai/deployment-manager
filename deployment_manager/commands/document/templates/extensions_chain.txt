Generate python code using the Diagrams library that will visualize extensions (think of them as "microservices") as they are running one after the other.

The code should define the diagram and then save it in the local directory, name it 'extensions_chain.png' or something like that.

You will get a list of extensions, for each, you will get:
- id
- name
- run_after => IDs of extensions that run BEFORE this extension.

Your output should use extension names, not IDs.

{extensions}

Return only code that can be directly executed! No markdown wrapper, just code.
