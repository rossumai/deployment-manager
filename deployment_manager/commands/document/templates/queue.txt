Generate markdown documentation for a group of Rossum objects. The primary object is the queue with the following fields:

{queue_json}

General information about Rossum configurations:
- Each queue lives in a single workspace.
- Workspaces can have 0-n queues.
- Each queue has its own schema (1:1)
- Each queue has 0-1 inbox which can accept emails with attachments. The attachments become documents in that queue.
- Queues hold annotations (documents) that are first read by AI and then reviewed by users.
- Hooks (aka extensions) run some functionality based on an event related to a specific annotation.
- Hooks can be assigned to 0-n queues.
- You can recognize the type of the object by its URL (e.g., https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/workspaces/595306 -> workspace)

Here is documentation for extensions related to the queue:

{hook_documentations}

Here is documentation for schema_ids (fields) in that specific queue:
