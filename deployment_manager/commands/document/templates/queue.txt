Generate markdown documentation for a Rossum queue. The queue has the following fields:

{queue_json}

General information about Rossum configurations:
- Each queue lives in a single workspace.
- Workspaces can have 0-n queues.
- Each queue has its own schema (1:1)
- Each queue has 0-1 inbox which can accept emails with attachments. The attachments become documents in that queue.
- Queues hold annotations (documents) that are first read by AI and then reviewed by users.
- Hooks (aka extensions) run some functionality based on an event related to a specific annotation.
- Hooks can be assigned to 0-n queues.
- You can recognize the type of the object by its URL (e.g., https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/workspaces/595306 -> workspace)

Here is documentation for extensions related to the queue:

{hook_documentations}

Here is documentation for schema_ids (fields) in that specific queue:

{schema_documentations}

{data_matching_documentations}

Make sure the output includes the following sections:
1. Queue Overview (h2 markdown)
- In a format of a table, provide overview information of the queue in the following columns: queue name, queue id, workspace it belongs to, and, if applicable, the associated email address
- Queue usage description (h3 markdown): overall description of the use case of the queue based on the documentation of its sub-objects.
2. Summary of extensions (h2 markdown)
Provide a summary for each extension listed above (format: numbered list).
3. Summary of fields (h2 markdown)
Table of fields referenced above, with columns "ID", "Label", "Description", "Field type", "Data Type", "Required/Optional", "Visible/Hidden"
Sort the fields by "theme" (e.g., basic information: document_id, ...), you don't need to list the themes though.
