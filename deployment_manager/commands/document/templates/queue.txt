Generate markdown documentation for a group of Rossum objects. The primary object is the queue with the following fields:

{queue_json}

General information about Rossum configurations:
- Each queue lives in a single workspace.
- Workspaces can have 0-n queues.
- Each queue has its own schema (1:1)
- Each queue has 0-1 inbox which can accept emails with attachments. The attachments become documents in that queue.
- Queues hold annotations (documents) that are first read by AI and then reviewed by users.
- Hooks (aka extensions) run some functionality based on an event related to a specific annotation.
- Hooks can be assigned to 0-n queues.
- You can recognize the type of the object by its URL (e.g., https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/workspaces/595306 -> workspace)

Here is documentation for extensions related to the queue:

{hook_documentations}

Here is documentation for schema_ids (fields) in that specific queue:

{schema_documentations}

Make sure the output includes the following sections:
1. Queue Overview
In a format of a table, provide overview information of the queue in the following columns Queue name, queue id, workspace it belongs to and if applicable the associated email address
Overall description of the use case of the queue based on the documentation of its sub-objects.
2. Summary of extensions
Provide a summary for each extension listed above.
3. Summary of fields
Table of fields referenced above, with columns "ID", "Label", "Description", "required/optional", "visible/hidden"
Sort the fields by "theme" (e.g., basic information: document_id, ...), you don't need to list the themes though.
