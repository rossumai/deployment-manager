Generate markdown documentation for a Rossum queue. The queue has the following fields:

{queue_json}

General information about Rossum configurations:
- Each queue lives in a single workspace.
- Workspaces can have 0-n queues.
- Each queue has its own schema (1:1)
- Each queue has 0-1 inbox which can accept emails with attachments. The attachments become documents in that queue.
- Queues hold annotations (documents) that are first read by AI and then reviewed by users.
- Hooks (aka extensions) run some functionality based on an event related to a specific annotation.
- Hooks can be assigned to 0-n queues.
- You can recognize the type of the object by its URL (e.g., https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/workspaces/595306 -> workspace)
- You can recognize the field section by 1st child object of the schema_ids array provided below with the following attributes for example ("category": "section", "id": "basic_info_section", "label": "Basic Information"). Return the Label
Here is documentation for extensions related to the queue:

Here is the documentation of the hook events in their succession: annotation_content.initialize > annotation_content.started > annotation_status.changed > annotation_content.user_update > annotation_content.updated > annotation_content.confirm > annotation_content.export

{hook_documentations}

Here is documentation for schema_ids (fields) in that specific queue:

{schema_documentations}

{data_matching_documentations}

Make sure the output includes the following sections  (omit any urls from output):
"1. Queue Overview" (h2 markdown)
- In a format of a table, provide overview information of the queue in the following columns: queue name, queue id, workspace it belongs to, and, if applicable, the associated email address
- Queue usage description (h3 markdown): overall description of the use case of the queue based on the documentation of its sub-objects.
"2. Summary of extensions" (h2 markdown)
Provide a summary for each extension listed above (format: numbered list sorted according to the hooks event succession).
"3. Summary of fields" (h2 markdown)
Group the Fields by the Sections they belong to (e.g., basic information, amounts...) and sort them alphabetically from A to Z
Return a markdown table of fields referenced above, with columns "Rossum Section", "ID", "Label", "Description", "Field type", "Data Type", "Required/Optional", "Visible/Hidden"
