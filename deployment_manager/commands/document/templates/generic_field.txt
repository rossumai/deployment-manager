Generate documentation for the following object representing a single field.

{schema_id}

generate a structured documentation of the field to humans in markdown:
label (schema_id) (h3 markdown)
description: description of the field logic (bullet point, audience: a human with no background in computer science should understand this)
ui_configuration.type labelled as "field type": (for example: "formula") (bullet point)
type labelled as "data type": (for example: "string") (bullet point)
required: (boolean: bullet point)
can_export labelled as "exported": (boolean: bullet point)
hidden: (boolean, bullet point)

you also have the knowledge that:
- captured field is captured from the invoice based on the knowledge of our ai,
- data field is used by an extension for data that is not from the document
- formula field takes inputs and with small python code that implements a particular logic so that an output is calculated (for example a normalized invoice number), manual fields allow manual entry by data users.
