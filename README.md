# Rossum deployment tool #

This command line tool is used to help users customizing and delivering projects on Rossum platform to easily track changes, deploy and release changes/entire project to different environments inside the same cluster.

### Prerequisites ###
*git* - any git based versioning tool  
*rossum account* - *admin* role credentials to at least one organization

### Terms ###
*source* - organization/workspace, usually used for development and testing  
*target* - organization/workspace, usually production, where the project and all its associated objects are pushed after development and testing is finished in the *source* organization/workspace  
*local* - file storage of the local machine where git repository of the project is cloned  
*remote* - organization and all the objects owned by the organization in Rossum platform

## Installation Guide ##

```
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install .
```

Restart the terminal.

## User Guide ##

#### How to initialize empty project ####

Run `prd init <project_name>` which will initialize an empty GIT repository.  
Fill in the required credentials in the `.env` file - `API_BASE` (ie.: https://elis.rossum.ai/api/v1) and either `TOKEN` or `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If you are going to deploy the code to different Rossum organization configure `TO_API_BASE` and either `TO_TOKEN` or `TO_USERNAME` and `TO_PASSWORD` accordingly.  

If the `source` organization/worksapce(s) already contain some objects that can be pulled, inside the project directory run `prd pull` to download all supported objects.  


## Overview and commands ##

### Commands ###

```
pull
```   
Pulls (downloads) all objects from the `source` & `target` environment and updates (or creates) folder & file structure in `source` and `target` folder in the project's local repository. Environment used is the organization of the user (determined from the credentials provided in .env file). If no `mapping.yaml` file is existing, file is created and populated with records describing the pulled objects. If `mapping.yaml` is already existing, missing records for new objects are created and records for no longer existing objects are removed. If there are new objects found in the organization, an attempt is made to determine whether they belong to `source` or `target` (by analyzing existing `mapping.yaml` file). If this cannot be determined, user is prompted to classify the new object.
```
push
```
Pushes all eligible (see `mapping.yaml` definition) objects into the `source` organization in Rossum platform. 

```
push target
```
Pushes all eligible objects from local `target` to remote `target`.

```
release
```
Pushes all eligible objects from local `source` to remote `target`. This command replaces all variables and overriden attributes as defined in `mapping.yaml`

### Supported Rossum platform objects ###

    organizations, workspaces, queues, inboxs, schemas, hooks

.env
mapping.yaml
```

`.env` - base configuration file of the tool - contains rossum username/credentials as well as other global parameters  
`mapping.yaml` - file containing metadata of all indexed objects of the `source` enevironment and their respective couterparts in the `target` environment  

#### .env #### 
`API_BASE` - base URL of Rossum API, ending with api version - ie https://elis.rossum.ai/api/v1  
`TOKEN` - valid token generated for admin rossum account. Recommended is to use PASSWORD and USERNAME.
`USERNAME` - Rossum admin account username that is used to generate auth token used for all Rossum API calls  
`PASSWORD` - password for Rossum admin account username  

#### mapping.yaml ####  
Initialized when not existing or empty during `pull` command. Missing object records are automatically added to this file during `pull` command. Objects missing `target` attribute are copied to the `target` during the `release` and the file is then automatically updated with the `target` object IDs once completed.

`ORGANIZATION | WORKSPACES | QUEUES | INBOX | SCHEMAS | HOOKS` - object type name, used primarily to define structure of the mapping file.  
`id` - unique ID of the Rossum API object.  
`name` - name of the Rossum API object instance.  
`target` - ID of the counterpart object in the `target` environment.  
`ignore` - attribute controlling whether object is pushed to remote during `release` command. Object with `ignore:true` are not pushed to `target` environment. `source` is unaffected and `push` command always releases all changes from the `source` folder.  
`attribute_override` - keys representing attributes of the object on Rossum API are replaced with the value associated with the key during `release` call.  
`attribute_override.{key}` - name of the attribute to be replaced with value of the key - `name`, `url` etc. (basically any writable attribute of the API object).  
 
> Example: `attribute_override.name: "my production hook"`. `source` hook's name "my test hook" is renamed to "my production hook" when deploying the hook to `target` environment.  

`attribute_override.{key}.path` - used when only substring of the attribute's value should be overriden. For instance use to replace queue IDs commonly referenced in various hook.settings (MDH).  
`attribute_override.{key}.reference_type` - only when `path` is defined. This attribute specifies what value type is being overriden and looks for its counterpart in the `mapping.yaml` file. Possible values `ORGANIZATION | WORKSPACES | QUEUES | INBOX | SCHEMAS | HOOKS`.    

> Example: parameters are set as follows - `attribute_override.settings.path:configurations.queue_ids` and `attribute_override.settings.reference_type:QUEUES` - when `release` command is called, `source` object's `hook.settings` is parsed, the `path` is found and all queue references (supports integers, strings and URLs) are replaced with their `target` counterparts.
