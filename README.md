# Deployment manager

This CLI tool aims to help users configure and manage projects on the Rossum platform. It allows you to track changes made inside Rossum, apply locally made changes in Rossum, and deploy the entire project to different organisations.

## Installation guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12
- GIT

### Linux/MacOS

Install the latest version of the tool via pip:
```
pip install $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/rossumai/deployment-manager/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep '.whl')
```
**Make sure to restart the terminal before using the command.**

You can install a specific version by changing the URL, for instance, to install v2.7.0a (replace all the places where the version tag is referenced - but without letters in the .whl filename):
```
pip install https://github.com/rossumai/deployment-manager/releases/download/v2.7.0a/deployment_manager-2.7.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

In case the installation steps above do not work for you, you can install the tool into a Python virtual environment and link it to your $PATH:
```
# Assuming you are in your HOME directory...
mkdir .deployment-manager-venv
cd deployment-manager-venv
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/rossumai/deployment-manager/releases/latest | jq -r '.assets[].browser_download_url' | grep '.whl')


nano ~/.zshrc
# Add this to the end of the file
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.deployment-manager-venv/bin"
# After saving, restart via the following command:
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

1. Install the latest version of tool via pip:
```
$LatestURL = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/rossumai/deployment-manager/releases/latest").assets | Where-Object { $_.name -like "*.whl" } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty browser_download_url
pip install $LatestURL
```
2. Run this in your terminal to add the tool to PATH:
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& {Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rossumai/deployment-manager/main/add_to_path.ps1' -OutFile add_to_path.ps1; & ./add_to_path.ps1}"
```
3. Install GIT: https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

If you encounter errors during the second step, please make sure you have Python installed from [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), not from MS Store.

**Make sure to restart the terminal before using the command.**

You can install a specific version by changing the URL, for instance, to install v2.7.0a (replace all the places where the version tag is referenced - but without letters in the .whl filename):
```
pip install https://github.com/rossumai/deployment-manager/releases/download/v2.7.0a/deployment_manager-2.7.0-py3-none-any.whl
```


### Updating to a new version
You can use the same command as for installing the tool the first time. `pip` will recognize that you are installing a newer version and uninstall the previous one automatically.

You can also run `prd2 update` to install the latest version on GitHub in the `main` branch.

You can use the same command to also update to a specific version: `prd2 update <version_tag>`.

### Migration from v1

Please note that the new version of the tool (`prd2`) is not backwards-compatible. If you would like to use it for an existing project, we recommend downloading the whole project again via the new version and going from there. You can keep using the old version command under `prd`.

Here are a few specific tips when migrating projects manually:
- You need to make sure to pull the objects into the right directories that you create for them (e.g., `org/test` and `org/prod`).
- If you had an existing mapping, you would then need to manually assing the target IDs after generating a deploy file via `prd2 deploy template`.
- **The old version of the tool is still available under the name `prd`**, You can use it for older projects where the migration would not be worth it.

## Quick Start Guide

You can then start using the tool in any directory by running:
```
prd2
```


> ℹ️ Whenever in doubt, you can run `prd2 --help` to get guidance and overview of all parameters and options. `--help` is also available for all subcommands (e.g., `prd2 pull --help`).

### 1. Create a new project

Follow the CLI instructions to initialize a new project. **You must setup at least one org-level directory and one subdir**:
```
prd2 init <NAME-OF-PROJECT>
```

You will need Rossum API URL for your organization: take your Rossum URL (e.g., `https://rdttest.rossum.app/`) and append `/api/v1` to it (`https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1`).

You will also need a username/password to generate a token, `curl` example:
```
curl --location 'https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1/auth/login' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "username": "my-user",
    "password": "my-password"
}'
```

For each subdir, you can specify a regex for the name of objects. Once you `pull` objects from Rossum, these objects will automatically be placed into the respective subdir.
> This only applies if the object does not have a local copy in a different subdir though!

You can rerun this command later to add new directories into the project.

> ℹ️ Note: all dirs and subdirs need to be added inside the configuration file (`prd_config.yaml`) to work properly with PRD commands.

This command creates the specified directories and puts the provided credentials into them.

This command also initializes an empty GIT repository.

### 2. Get the objects from Rossum to the created repo
Reference one of your (sub)dirs and download (`pull`) changes from Rossum.
```
cd <NAME-OF-PROJECT>
prd2 pull <DIR-NAME>
```
You can reference the whole org-level dir (e.g., `sandbox-org`) or subdir(s) (e.g., `sandbox-org/dev sandbox-org/uat`) or any combination thereof. Org-level dirs are expanded into its subdirs.

Before downloading, the command checks if the local objects have any uncommitted changes and warns you if there are any (so as not to override them).

### 3. Get local changes back into Rossum
After you make changes in the project, run:
```
prd2 push <DIR-NAME>
```
The `<DIR-NAME>` should correspond to the directory where you made the changes. You can specify more.

Before uploading the changes, This command will check if the object `last_modified` timestamp on the remote is the same as the one for the local object. If not, the changes are not pushed unless you override this behaviour via the `--force` flag.

> ℹ️ Note: you currently cannot delete objects using `prd2 push`. But you can do so explicitly via `prd2 purge`.

### 4. Copy (deploy) configuration elsewhere
If you want to create a copy of your configuration (typically move a test setup into production), you first need to create a deploy file specifying what should be copied (deployed):
```
prd2 deploy template create
```

This command allows you to specify attribute override for all objects of a certain type. This is particularly useful for changing suffixes (e.g., `DEV` -> `PROD`). There are also other options related to moving objects between two configuration (see the reference below).

Once you go through the CLI guide, you can also make other changes manually in the deploy file (e.g., attribute_override of specific objects). Any object specified in the deploy file with an empty `targets` will have a new copy created. If there is an ID specified, this command will instead update the object with that ID.

Then you can go ahead and **run the deploy**:
```
prd2 deploy run <DEPLOY-FILE-PATH>
```
You will first see a plan of the deploy (what will be deployed, what are the changes) and then you are asked for confirmation that those changes should be applied.

If the command detects a difference between a **local** source object and a **remote** target object, it will try to resolve the difference. You will be prompted to resolve them if it cannot do so automatically.

> ℹ️ Note: If you are using deploy with an existing deploy file after updating PRD to v2.11+, include `--prefer=source` into your first deploy after the update. Otherwise, you will get source-target conflicts (there is no deploy state file yet to resolve them for you).

If there is any error during the planning phase, you will see an error and the deploy will automatically abort. If there was an error during the execution phase, PRD will log the error and stop deploying. Any intermediate results (newly created targets) are stored in the deploy file.

Once the `deploy` is finished, your deploy file will be updated with new information. If you created new objects, their IDs will be on the right hand side.

You can **update a previously existing deploy file** via:
```
prd2 deploy template update <PATH> --interactive
```
Without the `--interactive` flag, the update would fix names based on object IDs or add hooks assigned to the already specified queues, but it would not add/remove any of the specified objects in the deploy file.

You can leave comments in the YAML, they will get preserved (bar a few exceptions).

## User Guide

### Directory structure
A single PRD project corresponds to a single GIT repository. Inside the project, there can be any number of directories, each corresponding to a single Rossum organization.

These `org-level` directories are specified in `prd_config.yaml`. Example:
```YAML
directories:
  sandbox-org:
    org_id: '251437'
    api_base: https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1
    subdirectories:
      dev:
        regex: ''
      uat:
        regex: ''
  prod-org:
    org_id: '255590'
    api_base: https://rdttest.rossum.app/api/v1
    subdirectories:
      prod:
        regex: ''

```
The config specifies the URLs and org IDs for each org-level directory. There are also so called subdirectories.

Inside an org-level directory, there is always at least a single subdirectory. This subdirectory corresponds to a grouping of Rossum objects (e.g., "DEV", "UAT", etc.).

If the project has dedicated organizations for each part of the implementation lifecycle (TEST+PROD, DEV+TEST+PROD, etc.), then the subdirectory is usually only for compatibility reasons. But if there is a single organization for the whole project ("same-org"), subdirectories allow the segregation of testing and production objects.

The directories and subdirectories are relevant in 2 ways:
1. They are a part of the path to specific objects.
2. They are used in PRD commands to specify which parts of the project are to be used.

Commands like `pull` and `push` can take any combination of dirs and subdirs. Dirs are automatically expanded to include all of its subdirs.

Inside the subdirectories, there is always one folder for `workspaces` and another for `hooks`. Under each workspace, there is a folder for `queues`. Each queue subfolder then has the configuration for the queue, its schema, and inbox. In this respect, PRD is opinionated and expects each queue to have its own schema. Inbox is optional.

A full example of a project directory structure with 2 organizations and 2 subdirectories in the `sandbox-org` can be found below:

### Interactions with GIT

PRD has 2 mechanisms to keep track of changes when comparing local and remote Rossum objects:
1. Checking the `modified_at` timestamp
2. Checking changes tracked by GIT

#### Checking timestamps

##### Push

`push` command by default analyzes the `modified_at` attribute on each API object in the remote and compares it to the one in the local JSON object. If the `modifed_at` timestamp in remote is different from the local one, `push` will skip this object to avoid overwriting changes to the object made on the remote, but not existing locally.

You can override this and push such local objects with `--force` or `-f`.

##### Pull

`pull` command also utilizes the `modified_at` timestamp to compare local and remote objects. In this case though, it does so to only download objects that really did change in the remote. `pull` assumes this is the case when the timestamps are not equal.

You can override this and pull all objects with `--all` or `-a`.

#### Checking GIT changes

##### Push

`push` uses GIT to know which objects were changed locally and should be pushed to remote. If you add `--all` or `-a`, PRD pushes all your local objects, irrespective if they were changed or not.

##### Pull

`pull` uses GIT to prevent overwriting local uncommitted changes. If the timestamps are not equal (see above), but the object is tracked in GIT as modified, PRD will ask the user to confirm overwriting the object.

PRD does not create any commits for the user, but it expects the user to commit in the following situations:
- Running `prd2 pull` and having a synced up version of local-remote
- Running `prd2 push` and having a "working solution" in remote

> **Rule of thumb**: The user should commit local changes after a series of the same PRD command, before a different command is use. Example:
1. `push`ing changes made to an extension ->
2.  debugging in the Rossum UI and seeing that one more change is needed ->
3. `push`ing again -> commiting ->
4. `pull`ing changes a day later made by someone else in the UI


### Working with credentials

PRD commands almost always need credentials (Rossum API URL + token / password & username) to work properly. PRD tries to find and use credentials in the following order:
1. Use credentials from the org-level directory in `credentials.yaml` file.
2. If the credentials are invalid (e.g., expired token), ask the user for a valid one and save it for future use.
3. If there are no credentials in the file, ask the user for a token without saving it.

Some commands (e.g., `purge`) ask you for credentials every time because they can be used with any Rossum organization, not just the ones you have pulled locally.


## Full(er) Command Reference

### pull

When saving remote objects locally, `pull` tries to guess into what org-level dir and subdir to place the object . The org-level dir is clear based on the provided credentials. The subdir is evaluated/guessed in the following order:
1. If there is a single subdir configured in the org-level dir, use that one.
2. If a subdir has an object with the same ID, use that one.
3. If configured, try matching the subdir's regex against the remote object's name.
4. If there are any objects without a subdir left, ask the user if they want to manually assign them, otherwise do not save such objects.

`-c` or `-cm` parameter can be added to automatically commit all changes with default or custom (`-m` parameter) commit message.

The following object attributes are ignored - that means they are neither pulled nor pushed:
  - Queue: [`counts`, `users`]
  - Hook: [`status`]

The following attributes are *non-versioned* - they are pulled locally, but they are put into a separate JSON file. These attributes are "meta-fields", so their change does not mean the object really changed:
- `modified_at`

### push

If you have many local changes and want to push only some of them to remote, you can run `git add <selected_paths>` and then use `push` with `-io` or `--indexed-only` parameter which will only register changes added to GIT index.

`-c` or `-cm` parameter can be added to automatically commit all changes with default or custom (`-m` parameter) commit message.

### purge

This command allows you to remove objects from a specific organization. You always specify types of objects to delete (e.g., hooks, all, etc.).

You can either specify a locally configured org-level directory and optionally subdirectories to delete, or you provide an API URL + token and the command will find the right organization remotely.

The command first presents a plan of what it will delete and the user is asked to confirm. **This deletion cannot be undone, so carefully check what is being deleted and where before you confirm.**

##### Deleting unused schemas

You can delete only schemas unassigned to any queues that can accumulate in an organization:
```
prd2 purge unused_schemas
```

### deploy

#### Ignoring some attributes

**If an attribute is not deployed, it is not shown in the diff either, even though it may be different between source and target.**

There are several attributes that PRD never deploys (even though they exist locally):
- Inbox: [`email`]
- Hook: [`guide`, `status`]
- Organization: [`organization_group`, `users`, `creator`, `trial_expires_at`]

There are also attributes that PRD does not deploy by default because they usually should not be overwritten:
- Queue: [`automation_enabled`, `automation_level`, `default_score_threshold`, `settings.columns`, `settings.annotation_list_table`]
- Schema: [`score_threshold` (on each schema_id)]

> ℹ️ Note: You can make PRD deploy these attributes on specific objects by adding `overwrite_ignored_fields: true` into the respective YAML object.


For cross-org deploys, some parts of the Rossum configuration are ignored because they are not writable via the API:
- Workflow
- Workflow Step
- Queue: [`workflows`, `generic_engine`, `dedicated_engine`, `engine`]
(For same-org deploys, these attributes are maintained as they are, they are still not replicated!)

#### Automatic ID override

PRD has 2 methods of automatic ID replacement:

##### 1. Replacing IDs in known attributes (e.g., `queue.hooks`)

IDs of dependencies  are automatically replaced when deploying. PRD does a lookup of each source dependency to find its target equivalent.

PRD handles the following edge cases:
1. For a single ID, if there is no target equivalent, the dependency is kept the same (e.g., `queue.schema`) and a warning is shown.
2. For a list of IDs, if one of the dependencies has no target equivalent, the dependency is ignored and only dependencies with a target equivalent are applied. This can be overriden for queues and their hooks (see the deploy file reference below).
3. For both cases, if there are multiple target equivalents, their count is compared to the count of "siblings" of the current object:
    - If this count is equal (e.g., releasing 2 `queues`, each with its own version of `hooks), each sibiling object gets its own target equivalent (based on the index)
    - If the count is not equal, all siblings get the first target equivalent as their dependency.
4. **If the target object has any extra "dangling" dependencies (e.g., production queue has one extra hook) that do not have a source equivalent, these will be maintained automatically.**

##### 2. Implicit ID override = replacing IDs in `settings` and `metadata`

PRD scans these objects and if it finds any mention of a source ID that it knows about, it tries to find its target equivalent in a source->target lookup table. This lookup table is created during the deploy so it only knows about target objects that it created or updated.

This second override feature effectively takes care of replacing random queue_ids in hook settings and other similar cases where it is easy to forget to do this change. However, it is naturally less robust than the first override feature and works only for selected attributes mentioned above.

PRD handles the following edge cases:
1. There can theoretically be different target objects with the same ID (e.g., queue "22" and inbox "22"). PRD will flag such cases for you.
2. There might not be any known target ID to use, PRD will flag these for you as well.

In both cases, **if the ID was found in a list (not a single value), the source ID will be removed from this list** (for instance, unknown queue_id in `hook.settings.queue_ids` gets removed since it is a source queue and this is a target object which should not have any connection to source).

#### Source-target difference resolution

PRD maintains a *deploy_state* file for each *deploy_file* and inside this file, it tracks the object at the time of the last deploy. Because references (IDs) need to be replaced before deploy, deploy state tracks the object BEFORE the IDs were replaced but AFTER user-defined attribute override happened (e.g., name was replaced to "... (PROD)").

During deploys, PRD compares:
- **Source (S)**: current local object
- **Target (T)**: current remote object
- **Last Applied (L)**: version at last deploy (after override, before ID remapping)

This enables a **3-way merge** per field, with the following resolution logic:

| Change Scenario                | Resolution        | Notes |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `S == T == L`                 | Take any          | No changes |
| `S == T ≠ L`                 | Take S/T          | Both sides changed identically |
| `S ≠ L == T`                 | Take S            | Local-only change |
| `T ≠ L == S`                 | Flag rebase | Target-only change |
| `S ≠ T ≠ L` and `S ≠ T`     | Conflict           | Needs user resolution unless `--prefer` set |
| `path in ignored_fields`     | Take S            | Force source, skip diff logic |

#### Special Cases:
- **Rebase candidates**: Detected when only T changed (`S == L`). User is prompted if they want to rebase into source. **Rebase is local only, no `push` is done.**
- **Conflicts**: If no `--prefer` flag is set, conflict is reported with both values.

#### Multiple targets

A single object can be deployed to multiple target objects by specifying an array of `targets`. The smallest viable configuration example is the following:
```YAML
workspaces:
  - id: 521887
    name: WS1 DEV
    targets:
      - id:
      - id:

```
Attribute override is added for each target separately:
```YAML
workspaces:
  - id: 521887
    name: WS1 DEV
    targets:
      - id:
        attribute_override:
          name: WS1 UAT
      - id:
        attribute_override:
          name: WS1 PROD

```

#### Pull from production into dev

In cases where the user has a configuration in Rossum production and wants to replicate it for development purposes and then deploy changes back into production, the user can use `prd2 deploy revert <deploy_file>`. This will create a new deploy file that flips source and target and can be run just like any other deploy file.

#### Working with secrets

When creating a deploy file, PRD will ask you if you want to create an associated secrets file and for which hooks. The secrets file will be saved in a git-ignored folder `deploy_secrets` and will have an entry for all the hooks you selected. You can then fill in the secrets for each hook. Once you do `deploy run`, the secrets file will be used

Tthe path to the secrets file is stored in the deploy file.

#### Showing diffs

When using `deploy run`, the deploy plan will show you diffs between the source and target objects. If the target is being created, you might see IDs with many zeros at the end (e.g., `15093900000`). These IDs are placeholders for IDs that are yet to be created. In case you are updating and existing target object, PRD will fetch the its remote version and compare it to what will be deployed.

This diff feature is mostly there for you to see if your explicit `attribute_override` or the "implicit ID override" worked as expected. Please note that for brevity's and clarity's sake **not everything is shown in the diff**. The dependencies automatically replaced by PRD (e.g., `queue.hooks`) is not displayed since those changes are always made. Furthermore, attributes that cannot be recreated via PRD (e.g., `workflows`, `dedicated_engine`, etc.) are also removed from the diff.

#### Sharing between multiple queues

PRD expects each to find a schema next to each queue that you want to release. In cases where a schema is assigned to multiple queues, the release will not work. If you need to distribute schema changes, you can create a release from a source queue to all queues which currently share the same schema.

### hook

#### Creating a hook payload

```
prd2 hook payload <HOOK-PATH> [ -au <ANNOTATION-ID|ANNOTATION-URL>]
```

Given a local hook path, this command generates a corresponding payload (similarly to what the UI SF editor does).

You can optionally provide the annotation ID or URL (otherwise you will be asked by the CLI to provide it).

#### Testing a hook

```
prd2 hook payload <HOOK-PATH> [-pp <PAYLOAD-PATH> -au <ANNOTATION-ID|ANNOTATION-URL>]
```

Given a loal hook path, this command runs the hook and displays logs and the return value.

Optionally, you can provide an already created payload, otherwise a new one is created on the fly. You can combine an already created payload with a different annotation ID or URL than the one provided when creating the payload.


#### Syncing a hook with remote repository
Goal of this functionality is to allow the prd user to update his local python function with a python script from remote repository in a simple way.
##### Creating a template
```
prd2 hook sync template
```
This command interactively creates a config file for future sync. It asks user to input the path to local .py file and the remote .py file.
For the remote file, user can use either relative path from the repository, or full URL. When using relative path, script will be downloaded from the `master` branch.
User also needs to have an SSH key set to access private git repositories.

Then you can go ahead and **run the sync**.
##### Running the sync
```
prd2 hook sync run <SYNC-FILE-PATH>
```
User will first see a diff between the local and remote file and will be asked for confirmation that those changes should be applied.

Once the `sync` is finished, the local file will be overridden with remote file. To upload the new changes to rossum, users need to use standard `push` or `deploy` commands.

### docommando

> ℹ️ Note: This command requires access to an LLM running in Rossum's AWS account - it is therefore only available for internal users.

```
prd2 docommando
```

Use this to command to generate documentation by an LLM. The command should be run from the **project's root directory** (where prd_config.yaml is located); it will ask you for org dir and subdir and then documents every queue, hook, and schema in that dir/subdir.

The documentation then gets combined into one long writeup for each queue. A short general "use case" description is also created.

The command saves intermediate documentation files; repeated invocations use these files as a form of caching. If you want to regenerate the documentation (e.g., some object substantially changed), you can use the `-i` flag to ignore the cached files.

This command has an extra cost because of the LLM usage. You will the estimated costs at the end of the command. Even for large projects, the costs usually do not exceed a few USD.

### llm-chat

> ℹ️ Note: This command requires access to an LLM running in Rossum's AWS account - it is therefore only available for internal users.

```
prd2 llm-chat <DIR-NAME>/<SUBDIR-NAME>
```

Use this command to enter into a CLI chat window with an LLM (currently set to Claude 4 Sonnet). You can ask the LLM to answer questions or solve problems related to the configuration. The LLM has access to:
- Rossum API calls, including access to specific objects, annotations, etc.
- Knowledge base (vector DB of Rossum University + Elis API dumps)
- Data Storage API calls
- Extension logs from the API

## Deploy File Reference

You can leave comments in the deploy file and they will be preserved (in almost all cases) even after running PRD commands (this is different from PRD v1).

> ℹ️ Note: Unlike in PRD v1, there is no `ignore` option for objects. If you do not want to deploy something, just remove it from the deploy file. However, this does not work for objects like schemas since a queue always needs one.

For some objects, there are optional flags:

#### `queue.keep_hook_dependencies_without_equivalent`

By default, any hooks that did not have have a target equivalent found (the hook was not part of the deploy) will be removed from the list of the deployed (target) queue. If this flag is `true`, the specific queue will retain hook dependencies from source. **This only makes sense for same-org releasing**.

#### `queue.ignore_deploy_warnings`

If `true`, `deploy` does not display the warning that the queue has a workflow or dedicated engine defined. Note that this warning is shown only for cros-org releases.

#### `queue.overwrite_ignored_fields`

If `true`, `deploy` will overwrite target fields like `settings.columns` or `default_threshold`.

#### `schema.overwrite_ignored_fields`

If `true`, `deploy` will overwrite `score_threshold` fields.

- Difference between:

### Attribute override

To override attributes in target objects, the user can specify key:value pairs. The keys are JMESPath queries. The values replace whatever is found with these queries during the `deploy` call.

#### Using regex

Attribute override can also replace only a part of the value by using a regex:
```YAML
workspaces:
  - id: 538437
    name: Invoices US
    targets:
      - id:
        attribute_override:
          name: \bUS\b/#/EU
```
There is a `/#/` separator of the regex on the left and the static value on the right.

Do not forget to escape characters with special regex meaning like brackets:
```YAML
workspaces:
  - id: 538437
    name: Invoices (US)
    targets:
      - id:
        attribute_override:
          name: \(US\)/#/(EU)
```

#### Overriding objects

The JMESPath query for override can be used to replace non-primitive values (e.g., you can replace the whole `settings` object). However, careful if you want to override only a part of the object:

This overrides only the `som` attribute in the object's `metadata`:
```YAML
attribute_override:
  metadata.som: 'second'
```
This overrides the object's whole `metadata` attribute with `{'som': 'second'}`:
```YAML
attribute_override:
  metadata:
	  som: 'second'
```
